## About this Repository

This development adds Compaction-Aware Zone Allocation Algorithm to [ZenFS](https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/zenfs).

## Compaction-Aware Zone Allocation(CAZA) Overview

CAZA was designed based on how the compaction process selects, merges and invalidates SSTables in the LSM tree. 
As such, CAZAâ€™s design considering the compaction process of LSM-tree maximizes the zone cleaning efficiency of ZenFS by consolidating SSTables with overlapping key ranges located at different levels in the LSM-tree in the same zone and invalidating them together during zone cleaning.

Please refer [Compaction-aware zone allocation for LSM based key-value store on ZNS SSDs](https://discos.sogang.ac.kr/file/2022/intl_conf/HotStorage_2022_H_lee.pdf).
